		<h2>Course Policies</h2>
		<div class="section">
			<h3>Absence/Tardiness</h3>
			<p>
			Absence is excused only for valid   medical or personal reasons that have been properly
			documented and communicated to the instructor, either prior to, or a soon after the event(s)
			as is reasonably possible. Regardless of the reason, it is the student’s responsibility to obtain
			missed materials and information, to complete all assignments and/or exam(s), or obtain a valid
			extension. Late arrival to a class session is disruptive, both to the teacher and to the other
			students, and reflects an unprofessional attitude. Please do not bring food  into the classroom
			or computer labs; beverages are allowed but must be in a closable container. Attend to your  
			restroom needs prior to the class session.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section">

			<p>
			Students are required to conduct themselves in the classroom, studios, and labs in a respectful
			and constructive manner, and consistent with the guidelines provided in The Rudder. Additionally,
			cell phones and pagers must be turned off, instant-messaging, personal entertainment headsets,
			and non-course-related web surfing is strictly prohibited during class sessions. Performance
			regarding any of these items may inform the grading process at the instructor’s discretion.

		<div class="section">
			<h3>
				Non-Completion

			as illness or serious personal problems. An extension can be obtained by submitting to the
			instructor properly authorized written documentation (e.g.  note signed by doctor, or parent/
			guardian, etc.) A grade of “Incomplete” can be obtained ONLY upon  the request by the student
			and with the instructor’s consent, and will be issued only for substantial and clearly documented
			causes. Please refer to The Rudder for guidelines concerning withdrawal from a course.

			arisen. After receiving an accommodation form, the student should contact the instructor so that
			adjustments can be implemented in a timely fashion. The Coordinator  has specific guidelines on
			providing appropriate support services to students with various types of disabilities. For further
			information, contact Janine Allo, Hauke 007, 651-5961, <a href="mailto:allo@champlain.edu">allo@champlain.edu</a>.

				<h2>Competencies (College-wide & GDD Program specific)</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						1	Aesthetic Fluency	
					</h3>
					<p>
					This competency area includes the ability both to apply aesthetic principles to created
					works that evoke both emotional and intellectual responses in viewers, and to evaluate
					artistic works with regard to their aesthetic content within an historical and societal
					context. (Program)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						2	Creativity	
					</h3>
					<p>
					Creativity is the degree to which original thinking is evident in student work. Is the work
					very unique, and clearly the result of inventive thinking? Does the work reflect a very
					personal vision, and something totally unpredictable, even revelatory? (Program)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						3	Critical & Creative Thinking	
					</h3>
					<p>
					Critical thinking enables students to examine a problem, a question or a situation,
					integrate all the available information about it, arrive at a solution or hypothesis, and
					justify their position. More formally, critical thinking includes a wide range of cognitive
					skills and intellectual dispositions needed to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments
					and claims, to discover and overcome personal prejudices and biases, and to formulate
					and present rationally convincing reasons in support of conclusions. Critical thinking
					skills support creativity and problem-solving. (College)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						4	Discipline	
					</h3>
					<p>
					[Had been Professionalism.] The degree to which, and the consistency with which,
					one displays reliability in managing time, coordinating with others in a wide variety of
					cooperative situations, and manages materials and information. Discipline also reflects
					the motivation of the student, i.e. the attitude with which work is tackled. Does the
					student reveal a clear intention to give her or his best effort to address the challenges
					presented by the work under consideration? (Program)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						5	Ethical Reasoning	
					</h3>
					<p>
					Broadly speaking, Ethical Reasoning refers to all deliberation that concerns what
					individuals and groups should do, how they ought to act, and how we should treat one
					another. Literally, all human action, no matter how mundane or technical, falls within
					the ethical sphere. Excellence in Ethical Reasoning, then, requires (1) that we are keenly
					aware of the ethical dimension of all human action whether the action is individual or
					collective, and (2) that we can present and explain compelling arguments why we should
					or should not act in a certain way. (College)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						6	Global Appreciation	
					</h3>
					<p>
					Competency in Global Studies includes a set of knowledge and skills for living on a
					planet characterized by ever-closer economic, cultural, environmental interdependency.
					Through it, students will come to understand and take responsibility for their own and
					their nation’s role in global affairs.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						7	Knowledge	
					</h3>
					<p>
					This competency area reflects the amount of new information pertinent to the course
					demonstrably retained by the student as a result of listening to lectures, reading books
					and journals, and viewing and/or listening to all modes of media. (Program)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						8	Oral Communication	 
					</h3>
					<p>
					Oral communication competence is the ability to use oral and nonverbal messages to
					convey ideas, information and intentions effectively in a manner that is appropriate
					to the topic, situation and audience. It is the ability to use listening skills to interpret
					accurately and critically the oral and nonverbal messages produced by others, and to
					display regard for other speakers’ points of view. Finally, it requires being able to select
					or develop a topic, research that topic, and organize and evaluate gathered information
					for presentational purposes. (College)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						9	Quantitative Literacy	
					</h3>
					<p>
					Quantitative literacy ensures the understanding and communication of rules of number,
					pattern manipulation and associated terminology for everyday applications. It allows
					the individual to use numbers and formulate relationships between them, to analyze,
					interpret and develop an appropriate strategy for meeting that individual’s current and
					future needs in employment and everyday life. (College)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						10 Realization	
					</h3>
					<p>
					Graduates must demonstrate the ability to apply technical skills —computer or handrendered — appropriately to problems and tasks specific to, and to the levels required of, their discipline. Appropriate usage includes the practice of responsible, ethical, and legal use of technology, information, and software resources. (Program)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>
						11 Writing	
					</h3>
					<p>
					In order to demonstrate mastery of the writing outcomes, the student’s writing should be
					clear, coherent, concise, comprehensive, creative and correct in a manner appropriate to
					a specific audience and purpose. (College)
