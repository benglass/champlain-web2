<h2>Components</h2>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>
			Site Map
		</h3>
			<p>
				A flow chart style information architecture representing all of the pages that will be included in the final site design. The site must contain at least 2 levels of hierarchy (at least one top level page must contain additional pages within it). This should be executed in Photoshop or Illustrator and submitted in PDF or JPG format.
			</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>
			Final Design
		</h3>
			<p>The final design file will be submitted as PSD to the instructor as part of your final design package. It is expected that this file is organized (in terms of layers and folder names) according to the specifications covered during the course for file organization. This file will be used for building the HTML + CSS production version of your site. The final design file must include the following pages of your site:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Home Page
				</li>
				<li>
					At least 1 sub page
				</li>
			</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>
			Interactive Component
		</h3>
			<p>
				You will design and produce an interactive/animated component of your design to be achieved through the use of javascript/jQuery plugins. <strong>Examples:</strong> slideshow, lightbox. You are required to design the interactive component using photoshop and construct it as part of production of your final website using HTML/CSS/Javascript.
			</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>
			Style Guide
		</h3>
		<p>
			Once your design is finalized, you will also submit a Style Guide for your site, which will consist of the site design you have generated with a set of placeholder content in the content area. This content will be styled typographically to fit with the rest of the site design and must contain the following elements:
		</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		4 Levels of headings
	</li>
	<li>
		Content Images with captions
	</li>
	<li>
		Links (4 styles, unvisited, visited, hover and active)
	</li>
	<li>
		Unordered Lists
	</li>
	<li>
		Ordered Lists
	</li>
	<li>
		2 Levels of in text emphasis
	</li>
</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>
			Home Page Content
		</h3>
		<p>In order to get a sense of the relationship between design and content, the student will write content for use on the home page. Other pages in the design can use greek text (lorem ipsum), but all text on the home page will be written by the student. e amount and format of the copy is dependent on your project. Effective home page content communicate the following pieces of information:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Summary of what the site or organization does
						</li>
							<li>
								Overview of what areas/actions are available on the site (often achieved through primary navigation)
							</li>
						<li>
							Highlight of the most important area/content of the site with clear calls to action to drive the user to important pages.
						</li>
					</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
		<h3>
			Production Website
		</h3>
			<p>
				After completion of and based on your final design, interactive component design and style guide you will produce a working website in HTML/CSS/Javascript. CSS files will be linked to the HTML files rather than embedded so there is one CSS file used for the entire site. Site assets such as images should be organized into their own folder. Students will have in class studio time to work on building this production version of their site and will present the site as part of their final project presentation at the end of the semester. The final website will be submitted as a ZIP file to the dropbox as well as published to a domain name which students are required to purchase for the course.  
			</p>
			<p>The final production version of the website must include typographic styles which match the Style Guide design assignment and the HTML/CSS/Javascript production version of the Interactive Component.</p>

	<h2>Evaluation</h2>

    <div class="section">
		<h3>Criteria</h3>
		<p>
		A	successful	project	will	meet	the	following	criteria:
